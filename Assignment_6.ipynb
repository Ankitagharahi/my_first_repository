        "Consider a text editor where users can type, delete, and format text.\n",
        "Each action performed by the user, such as typing characters, deleting text, or applying formatting, can be stored as a command in a stack.\n",
        "When the user wants to undo their last action, the text editor can simply pop the most recent command from the stack and reverse its effects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Using a stack for this purpose is practical because it follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. The most recent action is the last one pushed onto the stack, and therefore, it's the first one to be undone. This makes the implementation of the \"Undo\" functionality straightforward and efficient. Additionally, stacks ensure that actions are undone in the reverse order of their execution, maintaining the integrity of the user's editing history."
